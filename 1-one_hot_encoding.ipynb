    "In the beginning were the words. So very many words. Our first step is to convert all the words to numbers so we can do math on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that our goal is to create the computer that responds to our voice commands. Itâ€™s our job to build the transformer that converts (or transduces) a sequence of sounds to a sequence of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by choosing our vocabulary, the collection of symbols that we are going to be working with in each sequence. In our case, there will be two different sets of symbols, one for the input sequence to represent vocal sounds and one for the output sequence to represent words.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's assume we're working with English. There are tens of thousands of words in the English language, and perhaps another few thousand to cover computer-specific terminology. That would give us a vocabulary size that is the better part of a hundred thousand. One way to convert words to numbers is to start counting at one and assign each word its own number. Then a sequence of words can be represented as a list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a tiny language with a vocabulary size of three: files, find, and my. Each word could be swapped out for a number, perhaps files = 1, find = 2, and my = 3. Then the sentence \"Find my files\", consisting of the word sequence [ find, my, files ] could be represented instead as the sequence of numbers [2, 3, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a perfectly valid way to convert symbols to numbers, but it turns out that there's another format that's even easier for computers to work with, one-hot encoding. In one-hot encoding a symbol is represented by an array of mostly zeros, the same length of the vocabulary, with only a single element having a value of one. Each element in the array corresponds to a separate symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about one-hot encoding is that each word still gets assigned its own number, but now that number is an index to an array. Here is our example above, in one-hot notation."

    "Our break from matrices is over. It turns out that Markov chains can be expressed conveniently in matrix form. Using the same indexing scheme that we used when creating one-hot vectors, each row represents one of the words in our vocabulary. So does each column. The matrix transition model treats a matrix as a lookup table. Find the row that corresponds to the word youâ€™re interested in. The value in each column shows the probability of that word coming next. Because the value of each element in the matrix represents a probability, they will all fall between zero and one. Because probabilities always sum to one, the values in each row will always add up to one.\n",

    "In the transition matrix here we can see the structure of our three sentences clearly. Almost all of the transition probabilities are zero or one. There is only one place in the Markov chain where branching happens. After my, the words directories, files, or photos might appear, each with a different probability. Other than that, thereâ€™s no uncertainty about which word will come next. That certainty is reflected by having mostly ones and zeros in the transition matrix."

If we want to improve on our second order language model, we can of course consider third- and higher order models. However, with a significant vocabulary size this takes a combination of creativity and brute force to execute. A naive implementation of an eighth order model would have N^8 rows, a ridiculous number for any reasonable vocubulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can do something sly and make a second order model, but consider the combinations of the most recent word with each of the words that came before. It's still second order, because we're only considering two words at a time, but it allows us to reach back further and capture **long range dependencies**. The difference between this second-order-with-skips and a full umpteenth-order model is that we discard most of the word order information and combinations of preceeeding words. What remains is still pretty powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov chains fail us entirely now, but we can still represent the link between each pair of preceding words and the words that follow.

    "\n",
    "The first thing that becomes apparent is that, when trying to predict the word that comes after ran, we no longer look at just one line, but rather a whole set of them. We've moved out of the Markov realm now. Each row no longer represents the state of the sequence at a particular point. Instead, each row represents one of many **features** that may describe the sequence at a particular point. The combination of the most recent word with each of the words that came before makes for a collection of applicable rows, maybe a large collection. Because of this change in meaning, each value in the matrix no longer represents a probability, but rather a vote. Votes will be summed and compared to determine next word predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing that becomes apparent is that most of the features don't matter. Most of the words appear in both sentences, and so the fact that they have been seen is of no help in predicting what comes next. They all have a value of .5. The only two exceptions are battery and program. They have some 1 and 0 weights associated with the two cases we're trying to distinguish. The feature battery, ran indicates that ran was the most recent word and that battery occurred somewhere earlier in the sentence. This feature has a weight of 1 associated with down and a weight of 0 associated with please. Similarly, the feature program, ran has the opposite set of weights. This structure shows that it is the presence of these two words earlier in the sentence that is decisive in predicting which word comes next.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert this set of word-pair features into a next word estimate, the values of all the relevant rows need to be summed. Adding down the column, the sequence Check the program log and find out whether it ran generates sums of 0 for all the words, except a 4 for down and a 5 for please. The sequence Check the battery log and find out whether it ran does the same, except with a 5 for down and a 4 for please. By choosing the word with the highest vote total as the next word prediction, this model gets us the right answer, despite having an eight word deep dependency."

It gets fed in to decoder, the column on the right in the image above, where it's labeled \"Outputs (shifted right)\".

It's also a great example of humans modifying their behavior to support algorithms, rather than the other way around.\n",

They're already established. What we really care about are the predicted probabilities for the next word after the end of the prompt. There are several ways to go about choosing what that word should be, but the most straightforward is called greedy, picking the word with the highest probability.\n",

These are the (x, y) coordinates of each point in the new space. Here's what a 2-dimensional embedding might look like for our toy example, together with the coordinates of a few of the words.\n",

Each example gives a little bit of learning that gets applied across a whole neighborhood of words.\n",

    "In this illustration I tried to show that by putting important components in one area (battery, log, program), prepositions in another (down, out), and verbs near the center (check, find, ran).

Words that are close to each other in the sequence have similar perturbations, but words that are far apart are perturbed in different directions.\n",

    "Since a circle is a two dimensional figure, representing a circular wiggle requires modifying two dimensions of the embedding space. If the embedding space consists of more than two dimensions (which it almost always does), the circular wiggle is repeated in all the other pairs of dimensions, but with different angular frequency, that is, it sweeps out a different number of rotations in each case. In some dimension pairs, the wiggle will sweep out many rotations of the circle. In other pairs, it will only sweep out a small fraction of a rotation. The combination of all these circular wiggles of different frequencies gives a good representation of the absolute position of a word within the sequence.\n",
