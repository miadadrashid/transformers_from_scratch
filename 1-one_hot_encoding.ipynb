    "In the beginning were the words. So very many words. Our first step is to convert all the words to numbers so we can do math on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that our goal is to create the computer that responds to our voice commands. Itâ€™s our job to build the transformer that converts (or transduces) a sequence of sounds to a sequence of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by choosing our vocabulary, the collection of symbols that we are going to be working with in each sequence. In our case, there will be two different sets of symbols, one for the input sequence to represent vocal sounds and one for the output sequence to represent words.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's assume we're working with English. There are tens of thousands of words in the English language, and perhaps another few thousand to cover computer-specific terminology. That would give us a vocabulary size that is the better part of a hundred thousand. One way to convert words to numbers is to start counting at one and assign each word its own number. Then a sequence of words can be represented as a list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a tiny language with a vocabulary size of three: files, find, and my. Each word could be swapped out for a number, perhaps files = 1, find = 2, and my = 3. Then the sentence \"Find my files\", consisting of the word sequence [ find, my, files ] could be represented instead as the sequence of numbers [2, 3, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a perfectly valid way to convert symbols to numbers, but it turns out that there's another format that's even easier for computers to work with, one-hot encoding. In one-hot encoding a symbol is represented by an array of mostly zeros, the same length of the vocabulary, with only a single element having a value of one. Each element in the array corresponds to a separate symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about one-hot encoding is that each word still gets assigned its own number, but now that number is an index to an array. Here is our example above, in one-hot notation."

    "Our break from matrices is over. It turns out that Markov chains can be expressed conveniently in matrix form. Using the same indexing scheme that we used when creating one-hot vectors, each row represents one of the words in our vocabulary. So does each column. The matrix transition model treats a matrix as a lookup table. Find the row that corresponds to the word youâ€™re interested in. The value in each column shows the probability of that word coming next. Because the value of each element in the matrix represents a probability, they will all fall between zero and one. Because probabilities always sum to one, the values in each row will always add up to one.\n",

    "In the transition matrix here we can see the structure of our three sentences clearly. Almost all of the transition probabilities are zero or one. There is only one place in the Markov chain where branching happens. After my, the words directories, files, or photos might appear, each with a different probability. Other than that, thereâ€™s no uncertainty about which word will come next. That certainty is reflected by having mostly ones and zeros in the transition matrix."
